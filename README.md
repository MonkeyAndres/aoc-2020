# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2020

It's almost christmas and for this year's advent of code I decided to do use TypeScript. Enjoy the solutions.

## Usage

```bash
# Run all solutions (watch-mode)
yarn test

# Run specific day's solution
yarn test <day-folder>

# For example day's 1 solutions
yarn test day01
```
